    <pre style="font-size: 1.5em;display: inline-block;">Here are some questions that we gat asked very often, and the answers to them</pre>
</header>
<body>
    <h1 class = 'question'>1.How does the elo system work?</h1><hr>
    <pre class = 'answer'>  Elo is a score given to a weaponball. Every weaponball starts with an Elo of 1000. After every battle, a set amount of Elo is calculated to be added to
the winner's Elo and subtracted from the loser's. The things the script takes into consideration while calculating the Elo subtracted/added:

    a) The Elo difference: if a weaponball wins against an opponent that has a higher Elo than him, he gains more Elo than he would've gained from a win
    against a weaponball with the same/lower elo. A similar concept applies to losses, if a weaponball loses against a opponent with lower rating opponent
    it will lose more Elo than if he lost to an opponent with the same/higher Elo rating;

    b) The Elo cap: the amount of Elo you lose/gain is capped at <b>64</b> in order to make the rankings more stable and less chaotic.</pre><hr><br><br><br><br>

    <h1 class = 'question'>2.What battles are taken in consideration?</h1><hr>
    <pre class = 'answer'>  The only batles taen in consideration are the regular 1v1s, extended 1v1s, and best of 3 1v1s, also I want to mention that for the best of 3 1v1s we
count only the final result.</pre><hr><br><br><br><br>

    <h1 class = 'question'>3.What programing languages are used?</h1><hr>
    <pre class = 'answer'>  I used html, css and javascript to develop the site, but the elo engine is made in python, in order to update the site I need to add a battle in the
json that contains all of them, run the python code, and it should automaticaly update.</pre><hr><br><br><br><br>

    <h1 class = 'question'>4.is this 100% accurate?</h1><hr>
    <pre class = 'answer'>  Nope. I am a human so I might make mistakes, I just made this out of boredoom, and becuase I have a weird obsesion with statistics, just because a
weaponball is first doesnt mean its the goat or that you have to like it lol.</pre><br><br><br><br>
